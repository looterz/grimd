:zap: Fast dns proxy that can run anywhere, built to black-hole internet advertisements and malware servers.

Based on [kenshinx/godns](https://github.com/kenshinx/godns) and [miekg/dns](https://github.com/miekg/dns).

# Installation
```
go get github.com/looterz/grimd
```

You can also download one of the [releases](https://github.com/looterz/grimd/releases), detailed guides and resources can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/looterz/grimd/wiki).

# Configuration
If ```grimd.toml``` is not found, it will be generated for you, below is the default configuration.
```toml

# Building
Requires golang 1.7 or higher, you build grimd like any other golang application, for example to build for linux x64
```shell
env GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -v github.com/looterz/grimd
```

# Web API
A restful json api is exposed by default on the local interface, allowing you to build web applications that visualize requests, blocks and the cache. [reaper](https://github.com/looterz/reaper) is the default grimd web frontend.

# Speed
Incoming requests spawn a goroutine and are served concurrently, and the block cache resides in-memory to allow for rapid lookups, while answered queries are cached allowing grimd to serve thousands of queries at once while maintaining a memory footprint of under 15mb for 100,000 blocked domains!

# Daemonize
You can find examples of different daemon scripts for grimd on the [wiki](https://github.com/looterz/grimd/wiki/Daemon-Scripts).

#Credits
This entire project was written in a single day by a pack of hungry goblins. They are very hungry. Please feed them. They're closing in.
